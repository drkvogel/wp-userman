Just use react, probably won't need mobx or redux. It's pretty simple in concept. A user will want to be able to see their details and make some edits. Username, Password (and a standard approach to changing that) history of games and the outcome - just use random names for game, whether player was axis or allies and which side won. And a list of current games which in future will be links. For now, that's enough. Simple, plenty of options for nice design and pleasing form elements. Learning about react form elements is a pretty big thing!
[20:07, 10/11/2018] Joe Grundman: oh, and who the opponent was in each game
[20:09, 10/11/2018] Joe Grundman: game history maybe could include dates too
[20:10, 10/11/2018] Joe Grundman: with this you can learn forms, jsonmockserver, react, enzyme for unit tests, importing css, and typescript if you go there. all useful stuff!
